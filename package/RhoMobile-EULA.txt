RHOMOBILE END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT


IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT!

- This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a binding legal document between Zebra Technologies Corporation (Zebra) and you, which explains your rights and obligations as an End User of Zebra products. "End User" means either (a) you as an individual or (b) your company, if you are using Zebra products in your capacity as an employee or agent of a company. You identify the specific "End User" during the registration process.

- By clicking on the "Accept" button, or by installing or using any RhoMobile products, End User agrees to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree to this Agreement, then you should click on the "Do Not Accept" button and do not install or use RhoMobile products.

- From time to time, Zebra may modify this Agreement, including any referenced policies and other documents. Any modified version will be effective at the time it is posted. To keep abreast of your license rights and relevant restrictions, please periodically visit the RhoMobile site at www.rhomobile.com and read this Agreement. By using any Product after any modifications, End User agrees to all of the modifications.


1. Introduction to RhoMobile's Products and License Terms.

1.1 What's Included in "Software". RhoMobile Suite offers many different software products, including Rhodes (basic application framework), RhoStudio, RhoElements, RhoConnect, RhoGallery and others. "Software" means any RhoMobile product that End User orders from Zebra and/or downloads from Zebra. The term also includes (a) related documentation, (b) any Updates (defined below) to the Software, (c) any add-ons, plug-ins, APIs or Internet-based components of the Software provided by Zebra (but not third parties) ("Supplementary Software"), and (d) any third party software embedded in or provided with Zebra's software ("Embedded Software"). End User's detailed rights to use Software are in Section 2 below. To be clear, any add-ons, plug-ins, APIs or other code offered by third parties or created by End User itself are not "Software", and Zebra is not responsible for and does not offer any warranty, indemnity or support for those items.

1.2 What's Included in "Hosted Services". "Hosted Services" include any Zebra online services products that End User receives as part of a paid Subscription.  Hosted Services can include a limited size "Sandbox" to run hosted RhoConnect, hosted push, and hosted application management (RhoGallery), and other online services provided by Zebra. "Hosted Services" always means the version of the Hosted Services as described in Zebra's then-current product descriptions. End User's detailed rights to use Hosted Services are in Section 3 below.

1.3 The "Products". This Agreement uses "Products" to refer to the Software and/or the Hosted Services.

1.4 The Subscription.  This Agreement uses "Subscription" to refer to the temporary arrangement to pay for and receive use of specific Products.

1.5 The Subscription Term.  This Agreement uses "Subscription Term" to mean the one-year duration of a Subscription and any subsequent one-year renewal term for which Zebra has received payment for the Products.

1.6 Software Maintenance and Support. Certain subscriptions include "Maintenance" to End Users.  Maintenance includes (1) any generally released updates, upgrades, patches, and bug fixes for the Software ("Updates") when and if generally released at Zebra's sole discretion, (2) web-based support and phone support (depending on End User's support level), and (3) other support features as described herein.

1.7 Limits on Authorized Users. When buying a subscription to the Software and/or a subscription to the Hosted Services, End User pays fees for a specific number of users, which are counted based on number of then-authorized users of Software and number of seats or logins for Hosted Services ("Authorized Users"). End User designates the Authorized Users. Authorized Users may include End User's employees, representatives, consultants, contractors, and agents.  End User may add Authorized Users for additional fees. End User is responsible for all use of the Products by its Authorized Users and their compliance with this Agreement.


2. License to Use RhoMobile Software.

2.1 Software, Generally. Zebra grants End User a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to use the Products during the Subscription Term, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Only Authorized Users may use the Software, and only up to the permitted number of concurrent Authorized Users (except for Non-Production Purposes, as described below). All use of Software must be in accordance with the relevant Zebra documentation and policies. End User may make a limited number of copies of the Software as is strictly necessary for purposes of data protection, archiving, backup, and testing and internal development (e.g., of End User Modifications or End User Plug-ins, as defined below, but not development of End User's unrelated products or services) ("Non-Production Purposes"). For clarity, End User's employees and contractors may use the Software for these Non-Production Purposes, and End User will be responsible for their compliance with this Agreement on all the same terms as for Authorized Users, except that these users will not count against End User's limit of Authorized Users, and End User will not need to pay additional fees for these users. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Zebra, End User may only install, use or make available the Software on End User's hardware systems, whether owned, leased or controlled. End User will be responsible for any use of the Software on any hardware systems not owned, leased or controlled by End User ("Uncontrolled Systems").

2.2 Updates and Supplementary Software. The terms for Software in this Agreement apply to any Updates and Supplementary Software, unless Zebra provides different terms. Zebra may cease making available Supplementary Software and Internet-based services used with the Software at any time.

2.3 Open Source Software. The Software may contain or be provided with components subject to the terms and conditions of "open source" software licenses ("Open Source Software"). To the extent required by the license that accompanies the Open Source Software, the terms of such license will apply in lieu of the terms of this Agreement with respect to such Open Source Software, including any provisions governing access to source code, modification or reverse engineering.

2.4 Rhodes and RhoStudio Software. This paragraph applies to any Software that Zebra makes available on a no-cost basis ("Royalty-Free Software").  End User must register with Zebra before using the Royalty-Free Software and End User agrees to update its information if it changes.  End User may use the Royalty-Free Software for non-commercial, internal purposes only for the period specified by Zebra (or, if not specified, perpetually, subject to the terms of this Agreement). After the expiration of the period, End User must delete all copies of the Royalty-Free Software. End User acknowledges that Royalty-Free Software may not be fully functional. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Zebra does not offer any warranty, indemnity or support for any Royalty-Free Software.

2.5 Source Code. Zebra may provide some elements of Software in source code form ("Source Code"). Unless otherwise specified, End User may modify Source Code solely to develop bug fixes, customizations, and additional features ("End User Modifications") and, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, may only use End User Modifications internally for purposes of using the Software licensed from Zebra.  Zebra will have no support, warranty, indemnity or other obligations relating to, and assumes no liability for, any End User Modifications or any effect they may have on the operation of the Products.

2.6 IP Protection Mechanisms. The Software includes license protection mechanisms designed to manage and protect Zebra's and its suppliers' and licensors' intellectual property rights. Whether using Source Code or not, End User must not modify or alter these mechanisms or try to circumvent them or the usage rules they are designed to enforce.


3. Use of Hosted Services.

3.1 Access Rights. End User may access and use the Hosted Services during the applicable Subscription Term, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Only Authorized Users may use the Hosted Services, and only up to the permitted number of Authorized Users. All use of the Hosted Services must be in accordance with the relevant Zebra documentation and policies.

3.2 Subscription and Renewals. End User purchases its initial one-year Subscription at the time of order. Prior to the one-year term expiring, End User will have the option to renew for successive terms of the same period (but no longer than one (1) year each) unless Zebra ceases to make a particular Software or Hosted Service available. Renewals are charged at Zebra's then-current rates unless otherwise agreed by Zebra in writing, and Zebra will, at its discretion, charge End User using the payment method on file on or after the expiration date or send End User an invoice.

3.3 Evaluations. Zebra may, at its sole discretion, make Hosted Services available for evaluation by End Users of Royalty-Free Software.  In that event, the "Subscription Term" shall not apply. Instead, the evaluation period shall be specified by Zebra. Zebra may notify End User of the remaining number of days through the Hosted Services. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Zebra does not offer any warranty, indemnity or support for any Hosted Services offered on an evaluation basis.

3.4 End User Data. Unless otherwise specified, End User retains ownership of any data or other content or information that End User provides through the Hosted Services, including any code uploaded to the Sandbox ("End User Data"). End User's use of the Hosted Services and all End User Data must comply with End User's own privacy policies and all domestic, foreign and international laws and regulations, including those relating to data privacy, international communications, and the exportation of technical or personal data. End User is solely responsible for the accuracy, content and legality of all End User Data. End User agrees not to submit any content that is obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, pornographic, racially or ethnically offensive, that encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense or give rise to any civil liability. End User will not submit any material (including any virus, bot, worm, scripting exploit or other harmful code) that is likely to harm or corrupt the Hosted Services or any computer systems or data. End User represents and warrants to Zebra that it has sufficient rights in the End User Data to grant the rights in this section and that the End User Data does not infringe the rights of any third party. End User agrees that Zebra may, in its sole discretion, delete or remove any End User Data at any time and with or without notice.

End User hereby grants Zebra a non-exclusive license to copy, distribute, perform, display, store, modify, and otherwise use End User Data in connection with operating the Hosted Services.

Zebra may also use aggregate information to measure general Hosted Services usage patterns and characteristics of its user base and otherwise to improve its products and services, and may include such aggregate information about its audience in promotional materials or reports to third parties. This aggregate information will not reference names, phone numbers, email addresses, or other personally identifiable information, and it will be not traceable to a specific recipient or user email address.

3.5 Special Terms for RhoGallery. This paragraph applies to RhoGallery. If End User runs a RhoGallery repository, End User represents and warrants that it will accurately designate both the license under which the code in the repository is licensed to third parties and the project license for any contributions by collaborators. Project collaborators should carefully read all third party licenses before using any code or contributing any code. End User agrees to use RhoGallery solely as a code repository and not to upload any other content to RhoGallery (e.g., music or video). END USER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ALL CODE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH RHOGALLERY IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ENTITY THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE. ZEBRA IS NOT THE LICENSOR OF ANY THIRD PARTY CODE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH RHOGALLERY AND TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUCH CODE.

3.6 Storage Limits. Zebra provides different quantities of storage for End User Data specified when End User orders the Products. Zebra may create or modify storage quantities for the Hosted Services at any time, in its discretion, and End User acknowledges that it may not receive notices about these changes.

3.7 Return of End User Data. After termination or expiration of a Subscription Term or this Agreement, unless it was for End User's breach, at End User's request, Zebra will use reasonable efforts to make available the End User Data for download. If made available, End User must download the End User Data within 30 days of termination or expiration. After that, Zebra may delete the End User Data.

3.8 End User Responsibility for Systems. End User is responsible for its own Internet connection and must use software, systems and equipment compatible with the Hosted Services, as Zebra specifies in its published policies. Any End User web browsers and other software must support the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol or other protocols accepted by Zebra. Zebra is not responsible for any End User Data lost, altered, intercepted or stored across networks not owned or operated by Zebra.


4. Important Customer Obligations

4.1 Accounts and Passwords. End User will provide accurate, current and complete information when registering with Zebra and ordering Products and agrees to update its information if it changes. This is important, because Zebra may send notices, statements and other information to End User by email or through End User's account (e.g., for Hosted Services). End User will keep all its Authorized Users' passwords and usernames confidential and will not share them with third parties. End User is responsible for all actions taken through its accounts.

4.2 Embedded Software. All of the other restrictions for Software in this Agreement also apply to Embedded Software, with the addition of the following terms. End User receives restricted licenses to Embedded Software and may use Embedded Software only for its internal purposes (including for Customer Use as permitted below) in conjunction with the applicable Product as provided by Zebra, and may only use the Embedded Software as part of and through that Product. End User may not install, access, configure or use any Embedded Software (including any APIs, tools, databases or other components of any Embedded Software) separately or independently of the rest of the Product, whether for production, technical support or any other purposes, or otherwise attempt to gain direct access to any Embedded Software components, or permit anyone else (including Customers) to do any of these things. Notwithstanding any other terms of this Agreement, End User may not modify any Embedded Software. End User will be financially responsible to the applicable third party licensor ("Embedded Software Licensor") for all damages and losses resulting from End User's or its Customers' breach of this Agreement. End User may not "benchmark" or otherwise analyze performance information for individual Embedded Software elements.

Some Embedded Software may include source code provided as part of the Embedded Software Licensor's standard shipment. That source code will be governed by the terms for Embedded Software in this Agreement, and not the terms for Source Code in Section 2.5 (Source Code) above.

End User understands that the applicable Embedded Software Licensor retains all ownership and intellectual property rights to the Embedded Software. Embedded Software Licensors (and any other third party licensors of any components of the Products) are intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement with respect to the items they license and may enforce this Agreement directly against End User; but, to be clear, Embedded Software Licensor do not assume any of Zebra's obligations under this Agreement. In addition, End User agrees to the Embedded Software-related audit provisions in Section 6 (License Certifications and Audits) below.

Embedded Software may include or be accompanied by third party technology that may be appropriate or necessary for use with some Embedded Software. Such technology may be specified in the Documentation or otherwise specified in writing by Zebra, and is licensed to End User only for use with the Product with which it is provided under the specified third party license terms, and not this Agreement. Zebra may also provide additional or substitute terms for Embedded Software if required by the Embedded Software Licensor, and End User will comply with those terms.

4.3 Rules for Plug-ins. End User may develop its own plug-ins for various Products ("End User Plug-ins") and may distribute End User Plug-ins to third parties, but only for those Products permitted by Zebra, and only in accordance with Zebra's published plug-in and API guidelines.

4.4 Use by End User's Customers. End User's customers ("Customers") may be Authorized Users. End User will be responsible for Customers the same as any other Authorized User and must enter into valid, binding agreements with Customers consistent with this Agreement, including the additional conditions below. A Customer's permitted use of Products under this Agreement is called "Customer Use".

In addition to all other terms in this Agreement, the following conditions apply to Customer Use:

(a) End User may not distribute or make available any Product on a standalone basis. Instead, End User may only make available the Product to Customers in order to support Customers' use of content and features that are part of End User's own existing offerings.

(b) End User may not resell or OEM the Product or otherwise charge Customers for use of the Product itself, but may charge End Users as part of an overall program that includes access to End User content or features as supported by the Product.

(c) Customers may interact with the Product, but may not receive any administrator, configuration or similar access to the Product.

(d) In making Products available to Customers, End User may not violate any other term or condition in this Agreement, such as reverse engineering and anti-circumvention restrictions.

Zebra will not have any direct or indirect liability or obligation to any Customers, and Customers do not acquire any rights under this Agreement.

Zebra understands that Product usage may be flexible and that End Users may identify new proposed uses for the Products. If End User has questions about whether a proposed use complies with these rules, End User should contact Zebra through www.rhomobile.com.

4.5 Conditions on Use of Products. End User will not, and will not allow any Authorized User or other third party to: (a) resell, assign, rent, give, transfer, pass title to, lease, copy, provide access to or sublicense (including without limitation on a timeshare, subscription service, hosted service or outsourced basis) any Product to any third party (for use in its business operations or otherwise) or anyone else besides Authorized Users (including Customers) in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement, or permit anyone besides Authorized Users to use any data or information not owned by End User that is generated by the Products (and, in the event End User grants any security interest in any Products, the secured party has no right to use or transfer the Products); (b) use any Product to provide, or incorporate any Product into any product or service provided to, a third party, except as expressly permitted above for Customer Use; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, decipher, decrypt, or otherwise seek to discover or obtain the source code or non-public APIs to Products (including any data structure or similar materials produced by the Products), except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law despite this prohibition (and then only upon advance written notice to Zebra); (d) modify, adapt or create derivative works of a Product (excluding End User Modifications and End User Plug-ins); (e) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices of Zebra or any third party contained in any Product (including any information or data generated by the Products); (f) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of Products; (g) use any Product for commercial solicitation purposes or spam; (h) use the Zebra name or any Zebra trademarks or logos; or (i) commit any act or omission that could result in damage to Zebra's or its suppliers' or licensors' reputations. End User will not attempt to do any of the foregoing, encourage others to do so, or otherwise attempt to bypass or circumvent any usage restrictions in this Agreement.

4.6 Export Control. If a Product is acquired by End User in the United States, End User acknowledges that the Product is subject to U.S. export jurisdiction and End User agrees to comply with all applicable international and national laws that apply to the Product, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, as well as end-user, end-use, and destination restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments. In any case, the import and export of any Product may be subject to control or restriction by applicable local law. End User is solely responsible for determining the existence and application of any such law to any proposed import and export and for obtaining any needed authorization. End User agrees not to export, directly or indirectly, any Product (or any direct product thereof) from any country in violation of applicable laws.

4.7 Indemnification. End User will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Zebra from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim arising from or relating to (a) any breach by End User (including any Authorized Users) of this Agreement, (b) any End User Data, (c) any End User Modifications, End User Plug-ins or other modifications of or combinations with a Product, or any service or product offered by End User in connection with or related to a Product, (d) any Uncontrolled Systems, or (e) any representations or warranties made by End User (including any Authorized User) regarding a Product to third parties. This indemnification obligation is subject to End User receiving (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for End User to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim, provided that Zebra may participate in the claim at its own expense and End User may not settle any claim without Zebra's prior written consent; and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Zebra at End User's expense.


5. Fees and Payment

5.1 General. End User must pay all fees by their due date specified at the time of order or otherwise within 30 days of Zebra's invoice or notice. Renewal fees for Products will be charged as described in Section 3.2 (Subscription and Renewals). Late payments are subject to interest charges of 1.0% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is less, plus all collection expenses. End User will continue to be charged during any period of suspension. In event of any termination, End User will pay the unpaid balance due calculated in accordance with this section and this Agreement. Zebra may charge such unpaid fees and charges to End User's credit card or otherwise bill End User for such unpaid fees and charges. End User acknowledges that it is not relying on the future availability of any Products (including any Embedded Software) in agreeing to or making its payments hereunder.

5.2 Taxes. Payments made by End User under this Agreement exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received. To the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by Zebra, End User must pay to Zebra the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, End User may have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed. In that case, End User will have the right to provide to Zebra with any such exemption information and Zebra will use reasonable efforts to provide such invoicing documents as may enable End User to obtain a refund or credit for the amount so paid from any relevant revenue authority if such a refund or credit is available.


6. License Certifications and Audits

Upon Zebra's written request, End User will provide Zebra with a signed certification certifying that all Products are being used pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including any access and user limitations. With prior reasonable notice of at least ten (10) days, Zebra (or its authorized agent) may audit the use of the Products by End User and its Authorized Users and any Customers, provided such audit is during regular business hours. End User will provide reasonable assistance and access to information in the course of any audit. End User is responsible for such audit costs only in the event the audit reveals that End User's use of the Products is not in accordance with the permitted scope of use. In the event that any certification or audit reveals that End User has exceeded its permitted number of Authorized Users, Zebra may invoice End User for any past or ongoing excessive use and End User will pay the invoice in accordance with Section 5 (Fees and Payment). This remedy is without prejudice to any other remedies available to Zebra at law or equity or under this Agreement.

End User understands that Zebra may report audit results to any applicable Embedded Software Licensor or may assign the right to audit End User in this Section 6 to Embedded Software Licensors. When the audit is assigned, then notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, Embedded Software Licensor will not be responsible for End User's costs incurred in cooperating with the audit.


7. Zebra's Ownership Rights; Feedback

Zebra and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted to End User in this Agreement. The Products (including any content or information contained therein) and all copies thereof are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Zebra or its licensors own the title, copyright, and other intellectual property rights in the Products and all copies, modifications and derivative works of the Products and underlying software (including any incorporating Feedback) ("Zebra Technology"), and End User does not acquire any ownership rights in Zebra Technology. All Products are licensed, not sold.

"Feedback" means any feedback, comments, suggestions or materials (including, to the extent disclosed to Zebra, any End User Modifications, but excluding End User Plug-ins) that End User may provide to Zebra about or in connection with the Products, including any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained therein. End User may provide Feedback in connection with Maintenance and otherwise. End User hereby grants Zebra a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license to use, copy, modify and otherwise exploit the Feedback for any purpose, including incorporating or implementing the Feedback in the Products. End User agrees that Zebra may exploit all Feedback without any restriction or obligation on account of intellectual property rights or otherwise. For clarity, no Feedback will be deemed End User's Confidential Information, and nothing in this Agreement (including Section 8 (Confidentiality)) limits Zebra's right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.


8. Confidentiality

Except as otherwise set forth in Section 7 (Zebra's Ownership Rights; Feedback) above, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains ("Receiving Party") from the disclosing party ("Disclosing Party") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party ("Confidential Information"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be Confidential Information due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any Zebra Technology, performance information relating to the Products, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed Confidential Information of Zebra without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information. The Receiving Party's nondisclosure obligation shall not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information; or (v) is required to be disclosed pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party). The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.


9. Termination

This Agreement will continue so long as End User has an ongoing Subscription for the Products, unless earlier terminated. Zebra may suspend or terminate this Agreement and End User's account, with respect to one or more of the Products, if End User fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including any failure to pay fees when due. Zebra may terminate any free account or evaluation usage at any time in its sole discretion.

End User may terminate this Agreement at any time upon written notice to Zebra.

Immediately upon termination of any license or subscription right granted under this Agreement, End User's license to Products will cease, and End User must at its own cost: (a) cease using (and require all Authorized Users, and anyone else to cease using) all the terminated Products; (b) remove all copies of Software from its computer systems and any Uncontrolled Systems; and (c) return to Zebra all Software or provide Zebra with written certification that it has destroyed all copies of the Software and other Zebra Confidential Information in its possession, custody or control. Upon termination of this Agreement for whatever reason, End User will not be entitled to credits or refunds for any unused portion of any Subscription Term, including but not limited to unused maintenance and support.

All payment and other obligations accrued as of the date of any expiration or termination of this Agreement, and Sections 4.5 (Conditions on Use of Products), 4.6 (Export Control), 4.7 (Indemnification), 5 (Fees and Payment), 6 (License Certifications and Audit), 7 (Zebra's Ownership Rights; Feedback); 8 (Confidentiality), 9 (Termination), 11 (Warranties; Disclaimer of Warranties), 12 (Limitation of Liability), 13 (Publicity Rights) 14 (Assignment), 15 (Governing Law), 16 (DMCA Notices), 17 (Government End Users) and 18 (General) will survive expiration or termination.


10. Zebra Infringement Indemnification

Subject to the remainder of this Section 10, Zebra will indemnify End User by defending, at its expense, any claim to the extent based on an allegation that End User's use of a Product (in the form provided by Zebra) in compliance with this Agreement infringes a United States or European Union registered copyright ("Claim"), and will pay those damages and costs finally awarded against End User by a court of competent jurisdiction, or agreed to in writing by Zebra as settlement, as a result of such Claim, provided that Zebra is (i) promptly notified and furnished a copy of such Claim, (ii) given all relevant evidence in End User's possession, custody or control, and (iii) given reasonable assistance in and sole control of the defense thereof and all negotiations for its settlement. Zebra will have no obligation to defend and no liability for any damages or costs to the extent that a Claim is based upon: (i) use of a Product in combination with any non-Zebra product, software or equipment; (ii) use of a Product in a manner or for an application other than for which it was designed or intended to be used, regardless of whether Zebra was aware of or had been advised of such use; (iii) modifications to a Product by any person or entity other than Zebra (including any End User Modifications); or (iv) other circumstances or occurrences that are covered in End User's indemnification obligations in Section 4.7.

If a Product becomes, or in the opinion of Zebra may become, the subject of a Claim, Zebra may, at its option and in its discretion: (i) procure for End User the right to use the Product free of any liability; (ii) replace or modify the Product to make it non-infringing; or (iii) terminate End User's right to continue using such Product and refund, in the case of Software, any license fees related to this Software paid by End User (depreciated on a three-year straight line basis) or, in the case of a Hosted Service, any prepaid amounts for the service no longer being provided.

This Section 10 states the sole liability of Zebra and the exclusive remedy of End User for any infringement of intellectual property rights in connection with any Product or other items provided by Zebra under this Agreement.


11. Warranties; Disclaimer of Warranties

11.1 General. Each party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and that, if End User is an entity, this Agreement and each order is entered into by an employee or agent of such party with all necessary authority to bind such party to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

11.2 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, ZEBRA AND ITS THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS/LICENSORS PROVIDE THE PRODUCTS (INCLUDING THE HOSTED SERVICES, SOFTWARE AND ANY MAINTENANCE) AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND GUARANTEES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ZEBRA AND ITS THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS/LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO, AND ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR, ANY PRODUCTS PROVIDED ON AN EVALUATION BASIS. IN ADDITION, ZEBRA AND ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSOR/SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF ZEBRA.

END USER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE LIMITED WARRANTY PERIOD.

11.3 Hosted Services Facilities. The Hosted Services are controlled and operated from facilities in the United States. Zebra makes no representations that the Hosted Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Hosted Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including export and import regulations.


12. Limitation of Liability

12.1 MAXIMUM LIABILITY. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES PURSUANT TO THE PARTIES' INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN SECTION 4.7 AND 10 OR END USER'S BREACH OF ANY LICENSE OR USE RESTRICTIONS RELATING TO THE PRODUCTS, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES EITHER PARTY MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER PARTY'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY HEREUNDER SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE ACTUAL DAMAGES SUCH PARTY INCURS, UP TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY END USER FOR SUCH PRODUCTS, DEPRECIATED ON A THREE-YEAR STRAIGHT LINE BASIS.

16. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Notices

If End User believes that any content on Zebra's Hosted Services or site violates End User's copyright, it should notify Zebra in writing.

17. Government End Users

The Products include commercial computer software. If the user or licensee of the Products is an agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Software, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data and manuals, is restricted by a license agreement or by the terms of this Agreement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes.

18. General

This Agreement is the entire agreement between End User and Zebra relating to the Products and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and representations with respect to the Products or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except as described on the first page of this Agreement or otherwise with the written agreement of Zebra (which may be withheld in its complete discretion without any requirement to provide reasons). As used herein, "including" (and its variants) means "including without limitation" (and its variants). If either party to this Agreement breaches any provision of this Agreement relating to Confidential Information or intellectual property rights, there may not be an adequate remedy available solely at law; therefore, an injunction, specific performance or other form of equitable relief or monetary damages or any combination thereof may be sought by the injured party to this Agreement. No failure or delay by the injured party to this Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder at law or equity. The parties are independent contractors. This Agreement shall not be construed as constituting either party as a partner of the other or to create any other form of legal association that would give on party the express or implied right, power or authority to create any duty or obligation of the other party.
