1. Introduction to RhoMobile's Products and License Terms.

1.1 What's Included in "Software". RhoMobile Suite offers many different software products, including Rhodes (basic application framework), RhoStudio, RhoConnect, Rho-Tau-Extensions and others. "Software" means any RhoMobile product that End User orders from Tau and/or downloads from Tau. The term also includes (a) related documentation, (b) any Updates (defined below) to the Software, (c) any add-ons, plug-ins, APIs or Internet-based components of the Software provided by Tau (but not third parties) ("Supplementary Software"), and (d) any third party software embedded in or provided with Tau's software ("Embedded Software"). End User's detailed rights to use Software are in Section 2 below. To be clear, any add-ons, plug-ins, APIs or other code offered by third parties or created by End User itself are not "Software", and Tau is not responsible for and does not offer any warranty, indemnity or support for those items.

1.2 The "Products". This Agreement uses "Products" to refer to the Software.



2. License to Use RhoMobile Software.

2.1 Software, Generally. Tau grants Customer the worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, perpetual, irrevocable (except for uncured material breach) right to use, copy, and create derivatives of any materials provided by Tau. All the Software distributed under the MIT license.

2.2 Updates and Supplementary Software. The terms for Software in this Agreement apply to any Updates and Supplementary Software, unless Tau provides different terms. Tau may cease making available Supplementary Software and Internet-based services used with the Software at any time.

2.3 Open Source Software. The Software may contain or be provided with components subject to the terms and conditions of "open source" software licenses ("Open Source Software"). To the extent required by the license that accompanies the Open Source Software, the terms of such license will apply in lieu of the terms of this Agreement with respect to such Open Source Software, including any provisions governing access to source code, modification or reverse engineering.

2.4 Source Code. Tau may provide some elements of Software in source code form ("Source Code"). Unless otherwise specified, End User may modify Source Code solely to develop bug fixes, customizations, and additional features ("End User Modifications") and, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, may only use End User Modifications internally for purposes of using the Software licensed from Tau.  Tau will have no support, warranty, indemnity or other obligations relating to, and assumes no liability for, any End User Modifications or any effect they may have on the operation of the Products.



3. Important Customer Obligations

3.1 Embedded Software. All of the other restrictions for Software in this Agreement also apply to Embedded Software, with the addition of the following terms. End User receives restricted licenses to Embedded Software and may use Embedded Software only for its internal purposes (including for Customer Use as permitted below) in conjunction with the applicable Product as provided by Tau, and may only use the Embedded Software as part of and through that Product. End User may not install, access, configure or use any Embedded Software (including any APIs, tools, databases or other components of any Embedded Software) separately or independently of the rest of the Product, whether for production, technical support or any other purposes, or otherwise attempt to gain direct access to any Embedded Software components, or permit anyone else (including Customers) to do any of these things. Notwithstanding any other terms of this Agreement, End User may not modify any Embedded Software. End User will be financially responsible to the applicable third party licensor ("Embedded Software Licensor") for all damages and losses resulting from End User's or its Customers' breach of this Agreement. End User may not "benchmark" or otherwise analyze performance information for individual Embedded Software elements.

Some Embedded Software may include source code provided as part of the Embedded Software Licensor's standard shipment. That source code will be governed by the terms for Embedded Software in this Agreement, and not the terms for Source Code in Section 2.5 (Source Code) above.

End User understands that the applicable Embedded Software Licensor retains all ownership and intellectual property rights to the Embedded Software. Embedded Software Licensors (and any other third party licensors of any components of the Products) are intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement with respect to the items they license and may enforce this Agreement directly against End User; but, to be clear, Embedded Software Licensor do not assume any of Tau's obligations under this Agreement. In addition, End User agrees to the Embedded Software-related audit provisions in Section 6 (License Certifications and Audits) below.

Embedded Software may include or be accompanied by third party technology that may be appropriate or necessary for use with some Embedded Software. Such technology may be specified in the Documentation or otherwise specified in writing by Tau, and is licensed to End User only for use with the Product with which it is provided under the specified third party license terms, and not this Agreement. Tau may also provide additional or substitute terms for Embedded Software if required by the Embedded Software Licensor, and End User will comply with those terms.

3.2 Rules for Plug-ins. End User may develop its own plug-ins for various Products ("End User Plug-ins") and may distribute End User Plug-ins to third parties, but only for those Products permitted by Tau, and only in accordance with Tau's published plug-in and API guidelines.

3.3 Use by End User's Customers. End User's customers ("Customers") may be Authorized Users. End User will be responsible for Customers the same as any other Authorized User and must enter into valid, binding agreements with Customers consistent with this Agreement, including the additional conditions below. A Customer's permitted use of Products under this Agreement is called "Customer Use".

In addition to all other terms in this Agreement, the following conditions apply to Customer Use:

(a) End User may not distribute or make available any Product on a standalone basis. Instead, End User may only make available the Product to Customers in order to support Customers' use of content and features that are part of End User's own existing offerings.

(b) End User may not resell or OEM the Product or otherwise charge Customers for use of the Product itself, but may charge End Users as part of an overall program that includes access to End User content or features as supported by the Product.

(c) Customers may interact with the Product, but may not receive any administrator, configuration or similar access to the Product.

(d) In making Products available to Customers, End User may not violate any other term or condition in this Agreement, such as reverse engineering and anti-circumvention restrictions.

Tau will not have any direct or indirect liability or obligation to any Customers, and Customers do not acquire any rights under this Agreement.

Tau understands that Product usage may be flexible and that End Users may identify new proposed uses for the Products. If End User has questions about whether a proposed use complies with these rules, End User should contact Tau through www.rhomobile.com.

3.4 Indemnification. End User will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Tau from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim arising from or relating to (a) any breach by End User (including any Authorized Users) of this Agreement, (b) any End User Data, (c) any End User Modifications, End User Plug-ins or other modifications of or combinations with a Product, or any service or product offered by End User in connection with or related to a Product, (d) any Uncontrolled Systems, or (e) any representations or warranties made by End User (including any Authorized User) regarding a Product to third parties. This indemnification obligation is subject to End User receiving (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for End User to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim, provided that Tau may participate in the claim at its own expense and End User may not settle any claim without Tau's prior written consent; and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Tau at End User's expense.



4. Tau's Ownership Rights; Feedback

Tau and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted to End User in this Agreement. The Products (including any content or information contained therein) and all copies thereof are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Tau or its licensors own the title, copyright, and other intellectual property rights in the Products and all copies, modifications and derivative works of the Products and underlying software (including any incorporating Feedback) ("Tau Technology"), and End User does not acquire any ownership rights in Tau Technology. All Products are licensed, not sold.

"Feedback" means any feedback, comments, suggestions or materials (including, to the extent disclosed to Tau, any End User Modifications, but excluding End User Plug-ins) that End User may provide to Tau about or in connection with the Products, including any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained therein. End User may provide Feedback in connection with Maintenance and otherwise. End User hereby grants Tau a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license to use, copy, modify and otherwise exploit the Feedback for any purpose, including incorporating or implementing the Feedback in the Products. End User agrees that Tau may exploit all Feedback without any restriction or obligation on account of intellectual property rights or otherwise. For clarity, no Feedback will be deemed End User's Confidential Information, and nothing in this Agreement (including Section 8 (Confidentiality)) limits Tau's right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.



5. Confidentiality

Except as otherwise set forth in Section 7 (Tau's Ownership Rights; Feedback) above, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains ("Receiving Party") from the disclosing party ("Disclosing Party") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party ("Confidential Information"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be Confidential Information due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any Tau Technology, performance information relating to the Products, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed Confidential Information of Tau without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information. The Receiving Party's nondisclosure obligation shall not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information; or (v) is required to be disclosed pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party). The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.



6. Tau Infringement Indemnification

Subject to the remainder of this Section 10, Tau will indemnify End User by defending, at its expense, any claim to the extent based on an allegation that End User's use of a Product (in the form provided by Tau) in compliance with this Agreement infringes a United States or European Union registered copyright ("Claim"), and will pay those damages and costs finally awarded against End User by a court of competent jurisdiction, or agreed to in writing by Tau as settlement, as a result of such Claim, provided that Tau is (i) promptly notified and furnished a copy of such Claim, (ii) given all relevant evidence in End User's possession, custody or control, and (iii) given reasonable assistance in and sole control of the defense thereof and all negotiations for its settlement. Tau will have no obligation to defend and no liability for any damages or costs to the extent that a Claim is based upon: (i) use of a Product in combination with any non-Tau product, software or equipment; (ii) use of a Product in a manner or for an application other than for which it was designed or intended to be used, regardless of whether Tau was aware of or had been advised of such use; (iii) modifications to a Product by any person or entity other than Tau (including any End User Modifications); or (iv) other circumstances or occurrences that are covered in End User's indemnification obligations in Section 4.7.

If a Product becomes, or in the opinion of Tau may become, the subject of a Claim, Tau may, at its option and in its discretion: (i) procure for End User the right to use the Product free of any liability; (ii) replace or modify the Product to make it non-infringing; or (iii) terminate End User's right to continue using such Product and refund, in the case of Software, any license fees related to this Software paid by End User (depreciated on a three-year straight line basis) or, in the case of a Hosted Service, any prepaid amounts for the service no longer being provided.

This Section 10 states the sole liability of Tau and the exclusive remedy of End User for any infringement of intellectual property rights in connection with any Product or other items provided by Tau under this Agreement.



7. Warranties; Disclaimer of Warranties

7.1 General. Each party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and that, if End User is an entity, this Agreement and each order is entered into by an employee or agent of such party with all necessary authority to bind such party to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Tau AND ITS THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS/LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO, AND ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR, ANY PRODUCTS PROVIDED ON AN EVALUATION BASIS. IN ADDITION, Tau AND ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSOR/SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF Tau.

END USER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE LIMITED WARRANTY PERIOD.

9. Publicity Rights

Tau may include End User's company name and logo in a publicly available list of licensees and in its public communications.



10. Assignment

End User may not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of Tau (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), provided that the assignee agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement. Tau may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part without consent of End User. Any permitted assignee shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.



11. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the federal laws of the United States of America and the internal laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice of law rule that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) shall not apply. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) shall not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted.  Each party (a) hereby irrevocably submits itself to and consents to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (or if such court lacks jurisdiction, the state courts of the State of New York) for the purposes of any action, claim, suit or proceeding between the parties in connection with any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement; and (b) hereby waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, claim, suit or proceeding, any claim that is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of such court(s), that the action, claim, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of the action, claim, suit or proceeding is improper.



12. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Notices

If End User believes that any content on Tau's Hosted Services or site violates End User's copyright, it should notify Tau in writing. In no event shall Tau be liable for any damages of any nature or for any inaction by Tau unless End User provides Tau all of the following required information:

In order for Tau to take action, End User must do the following in its notice:

(i) provide End User's physical or electronic signature;

(ii) identify the copyrighted work that End User believes is allegedly being infringed;

(iii) identify the item that End User believes is allegedly infringing and include sufficient information about where the material is located (including which website) so that Tau can locate the material;

(iv) provide Tau with End User's contact information (such as address, telephone number, or email);

(v) provide a statement that End User believes in good faith that the item identified as allegedly infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law to be used by Tau; and

(vi) provide a statement that the information End User provides in its notice is accurate, and that (under penalty of perjury), End User is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner whose work is allegedly being infringed.



13. General

This Agreement is the entire agreement between End User and Tau relating to the Products and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and representations with respect to the Products or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except as described on the first page of this Agreement or otherwise with the written agreement of Tau (which may be withheld in its complete discretion without any requirement to provide reasons). As used herein, "including" (and its variants) means "including without limitation" (and its variants). If either party to this Agreement breaches any provision of this Agreement relating to Confidential Information or intellectual property rights, there may not be an adequate remedy available solely at law; therefore, an injunction, specific performance or other form of equitable relief or monetary damages or any combination thereof may be sought by the injured party to this Agreement. No failure or delay by the injured party to this Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder at law or equity. The parties are independent contractors. This Agreement shall not be construed as constituting either party as a partner of the other or to create any other form of legal association that would give on party the express or implied right, power or authority to create any duty or obligation of the other party.
